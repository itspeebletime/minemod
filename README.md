# minemod

MineMod (AI Mod Maker) CLI that simulates mod creation with optional image uploads.

## Usage

```bash
./minemod
```

```bash
./minemod --create "<MOD NAME>" "<MOD BEHAVIOR>" "<IMAGE (Optional)>"
```

The generated files are placed in the `generated/` directory, and any provided image
is copied there as a real file.
